Instructions: 

- When a creep is despawned, a "+X gold" animation happens; I would like to generalize and improve this concept: Any time a "Reward" is granted, i want an animation in frontend. 
- Similarly, everytime a cost is 'spent', i want an animation to appear indicating what was paid. 
- Use colors to distinguish between type of reward and combinations of reward - add these colors and maybe icons to the general reward an cost system and initialize them properly for turrest01 game mode. 
- Make sure the animation is smooth and visually pleasing, possibly adding appropriate audio sounds for certain cost origins (building buildings, sending creeps, ...?) and certain reward types (killing creeps, hitting a sent creep, ...?)
