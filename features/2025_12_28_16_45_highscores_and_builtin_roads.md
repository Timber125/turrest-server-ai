Instructions: 

- Terrain type "SPAWNER" and "CASTLE" should always contain a road, by default. 
-> This should make it so that the creep spawnpoint (center of spawner) will be occupied by road; and that the despawn point (center of castle) will also be occupied by a road. 
Double check the actual despawn point, feels like creeps are despawned 1 tile early on the road instead of in the castle. 

- Currently, every player sees his own color and HP at the top right of the screen; 
-> I'd like to add a rank-list at the bottom left of the screen, that will show each player's name in their color, and their score; this should act as a ranklist, ordered by highest-score top, lowest-score bottom 
-> Score is equal to remaining HP for the Turrest01 game mode, but should be abstract for other games. add the score component to the general "Player" class.
