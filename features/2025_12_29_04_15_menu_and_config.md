Instruction: 

- I want a standard menu popup when pressing escape like in most games - in multiplayer, game continues playing. Later in singleplayer this will pause the game. 
# Continue 
# Options 
   - Keymapping & Sound config
# Stats 
   - Shows game stats / graphs and numbers 
# Quit 


This means that: 
- We will map all actions on what seem to be logical default keys so we can perform actions with our keyboard 
- We will add options to configure sound (music / effects / master)
- Server will keep track of stats for a game (and remove them from memory when all players have quit) which players can request (via opening menu > stats)

And i want an export / import option for keymappings
